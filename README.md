**Image Optimize Command** is a WP CLI wrapper for [spatie/image-optimizer](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer) which **optimize `gif`, `jpeg`, `jpg`, `png`, `svg`, `webp` images by running them through a chain of various image <a href="https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer#optimization-tools">optimization tools</a>.** Read [the introductory blog post](https://typist.tech/articles/easily-optimize-wordpress-images-using-wp-cli-and-some-binaries/) about why I built it.


## Usage

```sh-session
# optimize specific attachments
$ wp image-optimize attachment 123 223 323

# optimize certain number of attachments
$ wp image-optimize batch --limit=20

# restore the full sized images of specific attachments
$ wp image-optimize restore 123 223 323
$ wp media regenerate 123 223 323

# restore all full sized images and drop all meta flags
$ wp image-optimize reset
$ wp media regenerate

# Find and optimize images under a given directory **without backup**
$ wp image-optimize find /path/to/my/directory --extensions=gif,jpeg,jpg,png,svg,webp

# shortcusts for `wp image-optimize find` **without backup**
$ wp image-optimize mu-plugins
$ wp image-optimize plugins
$ wp image-optimize themes
$ wp image-optimize wp-admin
$ wp image-optimize wp-includes

# learn more
$ wp help image-optimize
$ wp help image-optimize <subcommand>
```

## Requirements

- PHP v7.2 or later
- [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) v2.3.0 or greater

Since [`wp-cli/wp-cli-bundle` bundles an older version of `symfony/process`](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli-bundle/blob/7e3d89c415db7922e923703d5f06613f0a60b8a9/composer.lock#L1204-L1205) which incompatible with [`spatie/image-optimizer`](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer/blob/48f71b968f2764eca8f4885a8a5401d61e920ba8/composer.json#L22), WP-CLI must be [installed via composer](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/#installing-via-composer).

## Installation

```sh-session
$ wp package install typisttech/image-optimize-command:@stable
```

### Optimization tools

Under the hood, `image-optimize-command` invokes [`spatie/image-optimizer`](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer) which requires these binaries installed:

- [JpegOptim](http://freecode.com/projects/jpegoptim)
- [Optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/)
- [Pngquant 2](https://pngquant.org/)
- [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo)
- [Gifsicle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/)
- [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/)

Check `spatie/image-optimizer`'s readme for [install instructions](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer#optimization-tools).

Note that `spatie/image-optimizer` only supports Pngquant 2.5 and lower. See: `spatie/image-optimizer` [#97](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer/issues/97) and [#99](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer/issues/99).

#### SVGO and cwebp are optional

Note that [WordPress doesn't support svg files](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24251) out of the box. You can omit [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo).
However, if you have [enabled WordPress svg support](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-svg/?kaid=CGCHYHJJJMMF) and uploaded svg files to WordPress media library, you must install SVGO. Otherwise, the command will fail.

Same goes for cwebp.

## Use Cases

### First use

This command optimize both the full sized image(the one you uploaded) and the thumbnails(WordPress auto-resize these images for you).

Chances are the thumbnails are missing or never generated:

- theme switched after upload
- plugins activated after upload
- deleted the images from disk but not updated WordPress' database

Simplest solution is to regenerate thumbnails then optimize:

```sh-session
$ wp media regenerate
$ wp image-optimize batch --limit=9999999

$ wp image-optimize mu-plugins
$ wp image-optimize plugins
$ wp image-optimize themes
$ wp image-optimize wp-admin
$ wp image-optimize wp-includes
```

### After upgrading WordPress core / plugins / themes

```sh-session
$ wp image-optimize mu-plugins
$ wp image-optimize plugins
$ wp image-optimize themes
$ wp image-optimize wp-admin
$ wp image-optimize wp-includes
```

### Restoring the originals

This command backs up the full sized images before optimizing attachments. If you want to restore them:

```sh-session
# optimize
$ wp image-optimize attachment 123

# restore the full sized image
$ wp image-optimize restore 123
# regenerate the thumbnails from the original full sized image
$ wp media regenerate 123
```

### Migrating from image-optimize-command v0.1.x

Starting from v0.2, this command backs up the full sized images before optimizing attachments. To migrate from image-optimize-command v0.1.x:

```sh-session
$ wp image-optimize reset
$ wp media regenerate
$ wp image-optimize batch --limit=9999999
```

## FAQs

### What kind of optimization it does?

Mostly applying compression, removing metadata and reducing the number of colors to `gif`, `jpeg`, `jpg`, `png`, `svg`, `webp` images. The package is smart enough pick the right tool for the right image.

Check Freek Van der Herten's [article](https://murze.be/easily-optimize-images-using-php-and-some-binaries) explaining `spatie/image-optimizer`'s [*sane default configuration*](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer/blob/124da0d/src/OptimizerChainFactory.php).

### How to customize the optimization?

```php
use Spatie\ImageOptimizer\OptimizerChain;

add_filter('TypistTech/ImageOptimizeCommand/OptimizerChain', function (OptimizerChain $optimizerChain): OptimizerChain {
    // Option A: Send messages to $optimizerChain.
    $optimizerChain->setTimeout($xxx);
    $optimizerChain->useLogger($yyy);
    $optimizerChain->addOptimizer($zzz);

    // Option B: Make a new $optimizerChain.
    // See: https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer/blob/master/src/OptimizerChainFactory.php
    $optimizerChain = new OptimizerChain();
    $optimizerChain->addOptimizer($zzz);

    // Finally
    return $optimizerChain;
});
```

### How to skip backups / restorations?

:warning: The optimzation is [lossy](https://github.com/TypistTech/image-optimize-command#will-the-images-look-different-after-optimization). **If you skip backing up the original files, there is no way to recover the original files.** Proceed with caution.

```php

use TypistTech\ImageOptimizeCommand\Operations\AttachmentImages\Backup;
use TypistTech\ImageOptimizeCommand\Operations\AttachmentImages\Restore;

add_filter('TypistTech/ImageOptimizeCommand/Operations/AttachmentImages/Backup', function (): Backup {
    // TODO: You have to implement a null backup class.
    return $myNullBackupObject;
});

add_filter('TypistTech/ImageOptimizeCommand/Operations/AttachmentImages/Restore', function (): Restore {
    // TODO: You have to implement a null restore class.
    return $myNullRestoreObject;
});
```

It would be nice to have those 2 null operations in a separate package. Submit pull requests to mention it in this readme if you have implemented it.

### Does running `wp image-optimize attachment / batch` multiple times trigger multiple optimization for the same attachments?

No.

By default, boolean flags ([meta fields](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_post_meta/)) are given to attachments after optimization. This is to prevent re-optimizing an already optimized attachment. If you changed the image files (e.g.: resize / regenerate thumbnail), you must first reset their meta flags.

Note: The `find` subcommand and its shortcuts don't create meta flags.

### Will the images look different after optimization?

Yes, a little bit. This is lossy optimization. However, you won't notice the difference unless you have a trained eye for that.

See [`spatie/image-optimizer`](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer#which-tools-will-do-what)'s readme on binary options used.

### Why my GIFs stopped animating?

> When you upload an image using the media uploader, WordPress automatically creates several copies of that image in different sizes...When creating new image sizes for animated GIFs, **WordPress ends up saving only the first frame of the GIF**...
>
> --- [wpbeginner](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-animated-gifs-in-wordpress/)

Luckily for you, Lasse M. Tvedt showed [how to stop WordPress from resizing GIFs](https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/229724) on StackExchange.

### Can I use this on managed hosting?

No, you can't use this on managed hosting such as [Kinsta](https://typist.tech/go/kinsta), [Flywheel](https://typist.tech/go/flywheel) or [WP Engine](https://typist.tech/go/wp-engine) because they prohibit installing the binaries.

If you must use it on managed hosting, [hire a developer](https://typist.tech/contact/) to add SaaS provider integration:

- [EWWW](https://typist.tech/go/ewww/)
- [Kraken](https://typist.tech/go/kraken/)
- [ImageOptim](https://typist.tech/go/imageoptim-api/)
- [Imagify](https://typist.tech/go/imagify/)


### Do I have to install `SVGO` or `cwebp`?

**No**, if you don't have any svg files in WordPress media library.

**Yes**, if you have:

- [enabled WordPress SVG support](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-svg/?kaid=CGCHYHJJJMMF)
- uploaded SVGs to WordPress media library
- using the `find` subcommand (or its shortcuts) with `--extensions=svg`

Same goes for cwebp.

### `PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 999999 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 99 bytes)`

This is a common WP CLI issue. See: [https://bit.ly/wpclimem](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/common-issues/#php-fatal-error-allowed-memory-size-of-999999-bytes-exhausted-tried-to-allocate-99-bytes)

### Does it have a limits or quotas?

No, unlike other SaaS alternatives, this package runs on your server without any limitation on file sizes or a monthly quota. Totally free of charge.

### Is it for everyone?

No, it comes at a cost. Optimization is CPU intensive. Expect CPU usage rockets up to 100% during optimization. Schedule it to run at late night in small batches.

Learn more on [this article](https://typist.tech/articles/easily-optimize-wordpress-images-using-wp-cli-and-some-binaries/).

### Will you add support for older PHP versions?

Never! This plugin will only work on [actively supported PHP versions](https://secure.php.net/supported-versions.php).

Don't use it on **end of life** or **security fixes only** PHP versions.
